# Object-Relational-Mapping-ORM-E-Commerce-Back-End

I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
I can connect to a database using Sequelize
I enter schema and seed commands
a development database is created and is seeded with test data
I enter the command to invoke the application
my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags
the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
If I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
